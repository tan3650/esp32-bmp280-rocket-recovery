# esp32-bmp280-rocket-recovery
A basic rocket apogee detection and recovery algorithm using ESP32 and BMP280 pressure sensor. The code tracks atmospheric pressure changes to detect the highest point (apogee) in a small rocket's flight, and triggers a pin to deploy a recovery system (e.g. parachute).
